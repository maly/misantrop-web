Flipboard is really &#8222;killer app&#8220; for iPad. I&#8217;m very glad to see Flipboard for Android, but I&#8217;ve a [BlackBerry Playbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UL34EY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=dein-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004UL34EY) tablet. Fortunatelly it can run Android apps (conversion is necessary).

I love Flipboard, it&#8217;s my &#8222;must have&#8220;, so I decided to convert leaked .apk for [BlackBerry Playbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UL34EY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=dein-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004UL34EY). Here is it. _Converted to BAR from Android version, which is kindly published at [XDA developers forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1644212&page=93)._
